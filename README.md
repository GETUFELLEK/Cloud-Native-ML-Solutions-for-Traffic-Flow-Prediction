# Cloud-Native-ML-Solutions-for-Traffic-Flow-Prediction



This project aims to build a **traffic flow prediction model** using **machine learning** with **PyTorch**. The model is trained to predict traffic flow based on historical data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The project includes Docker integration to ensure consistent and reproducible environments for deployment and testing.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting traffic flow for a given location based on historical data. Traffic data is often time-dependent, and LSTM models are well-suited for modeling such temporal sequences. This project integrates:
- **PyTorch** for the model implementation.
- **Docker** for containerization and environment management.
- **Real-world traffic datasets** or dummy datasets for testing.

The key objective is to provide a model that predicts future traffic flow using a time-series approach and can be deployed in a cloud-native environment using Docker.

## Dataset

### Option 1: Real-World Dataset (METR-LA)
The project supports real-world datasets like the **METR-LA dataset**, which can be downloaded and preprocessed for traffic flow prediction. The dataset consists of traffic speeds recorded by sensors across multiple locations in the Los Angeles area.

To use this dataset, download it from [METR-LA Dataset](https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN) and place it in the appropriate directory.

### Option 2: Dummy Dataset
If a real dataset is unavailable, a simple dummy dataset is generated for testing purposes. You can generate the dummy dataset using the `generate_dummy_data.py` script, which creates synthetic time-series data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker**: To build and run the project in an isolated environment.
- **Python 3.9**: If running outside Docker (optional).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-flow-prediction.git
cd traffic-flow-prediction
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

If you are not using Docker and want to run the project locally:

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### Install Dependencies

If you're not using Docker, you can install the required dependencies directly:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using Docker

To ensure all dependencies are properly installed, Docker is used to containerize the environment. To build and run the project:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

```bash
docker build -t traffic-flow-prediction-pytorch .
```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

```bash
docker run --rm traffic-flow-prediction-pytorch
```

This will execute the training process inside a Docker container, ensuring that your environment is consistent and reproducible.

## Running the Project

### Using Real Data

1. Place the dataset in the root directory of the project or modify the dataset path in the script.
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python traffic_flow_prediction.py
```

or using Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm traffic-flow-prediction-pytorch
```

### Generating and Using Dummy Data

To generate dummy traffic data:

```bash
python generate_dummy_data.py
```

This will create a `traffic_data.csv` file, which can be used to run the model for testing.

└── models/                       # Saved models (after training)
```

## Model Architecture

The model is built using **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) networks in **PyTorch**. LSTMs are ideal for handling time-series data due to their ability to maintain temporal dependencies over long sequences.

- **Input**: The input consists of traffic flow data over a historical window (e.g., 60 time steps).
- **LSTM Layer**: The core layer that captures temporal dependencies in the traffic data.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: A fully connected layer that maps the LSTM outputs to the predicted traffic flow for the next time steps.

### Loss Function
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** is used as the loss function to measure the difference between predicted and actual traffic flow values.
